## How did fubuTV Free and HD start?

I felt left out when my friends were watching the World Cup at home.

A good friend recommended an indoor HD antenna.

I was amazed. After a one time $30 purchase, I was watching FOX, NBC, CBS, ABC, and Univision in HD for free.

It opened up a world of live sports, news, and entertainment that I'm still enjoying today.

If you're curious if an indoor HD antenna is right for you, [TV Signal Locator](https://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=29) can tell you what channels you can expect to get.
